# GPT-4 with Search

This is a command-line GPT-4 REPL that utilizes Google to search for the latest information. Its main objective is to showcase how a plugin system can be integrated into an LLM such as GPT-4.

## Usage

## Install

1. Get a OpenAI API key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), make sure you have access to GPT-4 API endpoint.
2. Get a Google Serach API key according to the [Instruction](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083058/programmatically-searching-google-in-python-using-custom-search).
3. Clone the repo.
4. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and then fill in the API keys.
5. Install the dependencies with `pip install requirements.txt` (or `poetry install` with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/))
6. Run the script with `python gpt_4_search.py` (or `poetry run python gpt_4_search.py`)

## How it works

The first step of the script is to present a list of plugins available for GPT-4. This list will then be merged with the user prompt and sent to GPT-4. The output will be analyzed to identify any plugin calls. If a plugin call is detected, it will be executed and its result added to the message context before being sent back to GPT-4 for further processing. This cycle continues until GPT-4 returns a response without any plugin calls.

The log file from the demo reveals the mechanics behind the scenes:

The present languages used for the development process are far more advanced.
Rust and Go have numerous set of advantages and used for web development
projects all over the world. Both the open-source programming language offers
some advanced features for developing efficient software, integrated
toolchain, memory safety and has a strong community of users.  
Even though both have a few similarities, they also have drastic differences
between each other. What are the major differences? Developing from scratch,
meeting various requisites and writing different types of programs.  
You will have a clear overview of when you can use it with the pros and cons
listed for both the languages. Depending on your requisites differs the choice
of programming language. On thinking about the coding experience and
popularity. Both the language share the same birth year. The Golang popularity
is on a hike from the beginning, But Rust has been experiencing stable growth
in popularity over these years with a strong community.
Rust vs Go: A Comparison
[1]
In summary, both languages compile to a binary that consume very little
resources, Rust is faster and has lower footprint but harder to learn unless
your team already knows C.

# If you are a manager…

  * Use GO for **Serverless** computing and FaaS.
  * Use GO if you are running in Google Cloud since most of the GCP services are based on GO APIs.
  * Use Rust for critical concurrent applications, monoliths or real time systems.
  * Use Rust to attract highly skilled developers.
  * Use Rust for large code bases and complex projects.
  * Use Rust to build **greener** projects.
  * If you are looking to add a new language and you cannot spend much time learning it, GO is easier to adopt than Rust.
  * Use any for microservices or Kubernetes.
Generally speaking **Rust will outperform Go** , but not by much and it will
vary depending on the use case, this is because of the garbage collector.
Depending on how often the **GC** runs the results may change. This is a
drawback in Go: **predictability**. Although the performance differences may
not be huge, Rust performance is predictable.

You can find some initial comparison here. As you can see, in Go, it is easy
to make mistakes that heavily affects performance. In other words, if you
don’t pay close attention and understand how Go works, your code will not
perform great and may have runtime defects, whereas in Rust, the compiler
guides you and force you to write high performant and safe code.
[2]
Right off the bat, there are clear differences between Go and Rust. Go has a
stronger focus on building web APIs and small services that can scale
endlessly, especially with the power of Goroutines. The latter is also
possible with Rust, but things are much harder from a developer experience
point of view.

Rust works well for processing large amounts of data and other CPU-intensive
operations, such as executing algorithms. This is Rust’s biggest edge over Go;
projects that demand high performance are generally better suited for Rust.

In this tutorial, we'll compare and contrast Go and Rust, evaluating each
programming language for performance, concurrency, memory management, and the
overall developer experience. We'll also present an overview of these elements
to help you pick the right language for your project at a glance.

If you're just starting out with Rust, it might be a good idea to brush up on
this beginner's guide before you read any further.
Go vs. Rust: My honest take

Let's start by highlighting the similarities. Both Go and Rust are open-source
and designed to support the microservices architecture and parallel computing
environments. Both optimize the utilization of available CPU cores through
concurrency.

But at the end of the day, which language is best?

There many ways to approach this question. I'd recommend thinking about what
type of application you want to build. Go serves well for creating web
applications and APIs that take advantage of its built-in concurrency features
while supporting the microservices architecture.

You can also use Rust to develop a web API, but it wasn't designed with this
use case in mind. Rust’s focus on memory-safety increases complexity and
development time, especially for a fairly simple web API. However, the larger
amount of control you have over your code allows you to write more optimized,
memory-efficient, and performant code.

# Pros and Cons of Rust and Go

**One expert’s take on the Pros, Cons, and Controversies of each language.**

If you have written code in either Rust or Go, you’ll recognize some
similarities and differences between them. While there is some overlap between
the goals of the two languages, there are plenty of differences between the
two. Each language offers benefits depending on the problem you’re trying to
solve.
When it comes to choosing between the two languages, I think in some ways it’s
more about your programming background than the specific problem you’re trying
to solve. You could probably frame most problems in a way that would fit into
a Rust codebase or a Go codebase.

In my experience at a startup, we chose to use Go, especially when we were in
a period of rapid growth because it was easy to pick up. New team members
could quickly start contributing and help build systems.

That’s definitely not exactly the case for Rust. It has a steeper learning
curve due to its unique memory model and can feel difficult to pick up. I’ve
found that teams with a C++ or Java background will likely pick it up quickly.
It seems to draw people who come from “big” languages rather than “small”
ones, if that makes sense.

You could probably frame most problems in a way that would fit into\na Rust codebase or a Go codebase.\n\nIn my experience at a startup, we chose to use Go, especially when we were in\na period of rapid growth because it was easy to pick up. New team members\ncould quickly start contributing and help build systems.\n\nThat’s definitely not exactly the case for Rust. It has a steeper learning\ncurve due to its unique memory model and can feel difficult to pick up. I’ve\nfound that teams with a C++ or Java background will likely pick it up quickly.\nIt seems to draw people who come from “big” languages rather than “small”\nones, if that makes sense.\n\n```", additional_kwargs={}), AIMessage(content='Pros and Cons of Golang:\nPros:\n- Faster than many other programming languages like JavaScript, Java, Python [0].\n- Easy to learn, making it suitable for quick onboarding of new team members [3].\n- Strong focus on building web APIs and small services that can scale endlessly, with the power of Goroutines [2].\n\nCons:\n- Performance may not be as predictable as Rust due to garbage collection [1].\n\nPros and Cons of Rust:\nPros:\n- Faster and has a lower footprint than Golang [1].\n- Great for critical concurrent applications, monoliths, or real-time systems [1].\n- Attracts highly skilled developers [1].\n- Better suited for large code bases and complex projects [1].\n- More predictable performance [1].\n- Good for processing large amounts of data and other CPU-intensive operations like executing algorithms [2].\n\nCons:\n- Harder to learn, especially for those without a background in languages like C++ or Java [3].\n- Increased complexity and development time for simple web APIs due to its focus on memory safety [2].\n', additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content='Q:thank you', additional_kwargs={})]

## Modifications

- Added standard Python .gitignore
- Added requirements.txt equivalent of Poetry files

All modifications of the `gpt-4-search.py` file are written as easily removable conditional blocks and can be found by searching "MARKDOWN_MODS".
- Added the MARKDOWN_MODS conditional (avoided os.getenv import)
- Added titles to the stored link data
- Added a newline after each output for readability
- Changed the link output to their titles with masked links
- Added a bold heading before the references are printed
- Changed show_references to return output
- Removed the readline import for compatibility
